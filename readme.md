# Custom Audio Player

This is a custom audio player that I made in react which makes use of JavaScript's built-in Web Audio API. It was originally for the Tolkien With Friends podcast website, but now it is also it's own module.  

### Tech Used:  
* Tailwind  with some custom colors and google fonts imported.
* React (Vite builder)
* Javascript Web Audio API
* Flask for fetching the audio from the RSS feed and JSONifying it for react.
* React-Icons for icons.
